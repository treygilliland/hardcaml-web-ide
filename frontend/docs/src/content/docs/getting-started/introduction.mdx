Hardcaml Web IDE is a browser-based environment for learning and experimenting with hardware design using [Hardcaml](https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml), Jane Street's OCaml library for digital circuit design.

## What is Hardcaml?

Hardcaml is a powerful library for describing, simulating, and generating digital hardware. It provides:

- **Type-safe circuit descriptions** - Catch errors at compile time
- **Simulation** - Test your circuits without physical hardware
- **Waveform visualization** - See signal behavior over time
- **RTL generation** - Export to Verilog for synthesis

## What can you do here?

### Learn Hardcaml

Work through interactive tutorials that teach you hardware design concepts using real, runnable code.

### Complete Nand2Tetris

Implement the entire Nand2Tetris course in Hardcaml - build a computer from NAND gates up to a CPU.

### Experiment

Try out circuit ideas quickly without any local setup. The IDE compiles and simulates your code in the cloud.

## Quick Example

Here's a simple 8-bit counter:

```ocaml
open! Core
open! Hardcaml
open! Signal

module I = struct
  type 'a t = { clock : 'a; clear : 'a; enable : 'a }
  [@@deriving hardcaml]
end

module O = struct
  type 'a t = { out : 'a [@bits 8] }
  [@@deriving hardcaml]
end

let create scope (i : _ I.t) : _ O.t =
  let spec = Reg_spec.create ~clock:i.clock ~clear:i.clear () in
  let counter = reg_fb spec ~width:8 ~f:(fun fb ->
    mux2 i.enable (fb +:. 1) fb)
  in
  { out = counter }
;;

let hierarchical scope =
  let module Scoped = Hierarchy.In_scope (I) (O) in
  Scoped.hierarchical ~scope ~name:"counter" create
;;
```

Try it out in the [IDE](https://hardcaml.tg3.dev)!
