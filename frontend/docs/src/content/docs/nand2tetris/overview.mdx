# Nand2Tetris in Hardcaml

This section guides you through implementing the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course using Hardcaml. You'll build a complete computer starting from a single NAND gate.

## What is Nand2Tetris?

Nand2Tetris (also known as "The Elements of Computing Systems") teaches you how computers work by having you build one from scratch:

1. **Project 1** - Boolean Logic (NOT, AND, OR, XOR, MUX, DMUX)
2. **Project 2** - Arithmetic (HalfAdder, FullAdder, ALU)
3. **Project 3** - Memory (DFF, Register, RAM)
4. **Project 5** - CPU and Computer

## Why Hardcaml?

The original N2T course uses HDL (Hardware Description Language). Hardcaml provides:

- **Type safety** - Catch wiring errors at compile time
- **Better tooling** - Real IDE with syntax highlighting
- **Powerful testing** - Waveform visualization built-in
- **Real HDL output** - Generate Verilog for synthesis

## How It Works

### The `N2t_chips` Library

All chips are available through the `N2t_chips` module:

```ocaml
(* Use helper functions for concise syntax *)
let not_a = N2t_chips.not_ scope i.a
let and_ab = N2t_chips.and_ scope i.a i.b

(* Or use modules directly *)
let o = N2t_chips.Not.create scope { N2t_chips.Not.I.a = i.a }
```

### Exercise Structure

Each chip has:
- **Stub** - Template code you complete (Nand2Tetris exercises)
- **Solution** - Reference implementation (Nand2Tetris Solutions)
- **Test** - Pre-written tests to verify your implementation

### Key Convention

N2T and Hardcaml have different MUX conventions:

| Convention | sel=0 | sel=1 |
|------------|-------|-------|
| N2T | out = a | out = b |
| Hardcaml `mux2` | out = low | out = high |

The `mux16_` helper follows N2T convention, so use it for clarity.

## Getting Started

1. Open the [IDE](https://hardcaml.tg3.dev)
2. Select a chip from "Nand2Tetris" dropdown
3. Implement the `create` function using `N2t_chips.Nand.nand`
4. Click Run to test
5. Check "Nand2Tetris Solutions" to compare

## Project Overview

### [Project 1: Logic Gates](/nand2tetris/project-1)
Build all basic gates from NAND: NOT, AND, OR, XOR, MUX, DMUX, plus 16-bit variants.

### [Project 2: ALU](/nand2tetris/project-2)
Build arithmetic circuits: HalfAdder, FullAdder, Add16, Inc16, and the ALU.

### [Project 3: Memory](/nand2tetris/project-3)
Build sequential circuits: DFF, Bit, Register, RAM8 through RAM16K, and PC.

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - NOT is just `NAND(a, a)`
2. **Build hierarchically** - Use previous chips to build new ones
3. **Check waveforms** - Visual debugging is your friend
4. **Compare solutions** - Learn from the reference implementations
